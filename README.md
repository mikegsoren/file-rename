# file-rename
A Node.js script that replaces a string or substring in the filename of any group of files.



## How to use it:

### 1. Install node modules
```npm install
```

### 2. Run node app

```node image-rename.js relative/file/path stringYouWantToReplace newString
```


I created this for the purpose of renaming large batches of images after mistakenly renaming 38 of them incorrectly.
